Project 57: Vaccination Queue

In this project, I worked on simulating a simple vaccination queue using Python. The goal was to practice different data types and structures while making it feel like a real-world problem.

What I did

Integers (Numbers):
I tracked vaccination counts and calculated the total, average, minimum, and maximum.

Strings (Text):
I created formatted reports with f-strings to summarize totals and averages in a clear way.

Booleans (Decisions):
I set a threshold and checked if the average vaccinations were above or below that standard. Based on the result, the program prints out either “Above Standard” or “Below Standard.”

Lists:
I managed a list of vaccination centers. I added a new one, removed one, and then sorted the list. I also displayed the list before and after the changes.

Arrays:
I used Python’s array module to handle a numeric version of the data and compared the sum of the array with the list to confirm they matched.

Dictionaries:
I stored vaccination center records using dictionaries with fields like ID, name, and value. I updated one record, deleted another, and then calculated the total value across all centers.

What I learned

This project helped me get more comfortable with:

Handling numbers, strings, and booleans in Python

Using lists, arrays, and dictionaries to organize data

Writing simple logic to make decisions

Creating small but meaningful reports from data
